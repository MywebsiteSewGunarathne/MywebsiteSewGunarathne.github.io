<h2>KOREAN CULTURE</h2>
<div id="section4">
<h3>South Korea shares its traditional culture with North Korea, but the two Koreas have developed distinct contemporary forms of culture since the peninsula was divided in 1945. Historically, while the culture of Korea has been heavily influenced by that of neighboring China, it has nevertheless managed to develop a unique cultural identity that is distinct from its larger neighbor. Its rich and vibrant culture left 21 UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritages of Humanity, the fourth largest in the world,[needs update] along with 15 World Heritage Sites. The South Korean Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism actively encourages the traditional arts, as well as modern forms, through funding and education programs.<br> According to the 2021 edition of the Press Freedom Index, South Korea has the highest level of press freedom on the Asian continent.
The industrialization and urbanization of South Korea have brought many changes to the way modern Koreans live. Changing economics and lifestyles have led to a concentration of population in major cities, especially the capital Seoul, with multi-generational households separating into nuclear family living arrangements. A 2014 Euromonitor study found that South Koreans drink the most alcohol on a weekly basis compared to the rest of the world. South Koreans drink 13.7 shots of liquor per week on average and, of the 44 other countries analyzed, Russia, the Philippines, and Thailand follow.</h3>

<p id="para2"><font size="4">Korean Architecture refers to an architectural style that developed over centuries in Korea. Throughout the history of Korea, various kingdoms and royal dynasties have developed a unique style of architecture with influences from Buddhism and Korean Confucianism.
Having been deeply influenced by Chinese architecture, traditional Korean architecture can be mostly recognized by its sloping roofs.
Just like in the case of other Korean arts, Korean architecture is distinguished by its naturalistic tendencies, simplicity, economy of shape, and avoidance of extremes.<br>
In Korean architecture, buildings are structured vertically and horizontally. A construction usually rises from a stone subfoundation to a curved roof covered with tiles, held by a console structure and supported on posts; walls are made of earth or are sometimes totally composed of movable wooden doors. Architecture is built according to the kan unit, the distance between two posts, and is designed so that there is always a transitional space between the "inside" and the "outside."
In the mid-Joseon period, the winglike bracket form appeared, which, according to some authors, better suited the peninsula's poor economic situation that resulted from repetitive invasions. Only in buildings of importance like palaces or sometimes temples were the multicluster brackets still used. Korean Confucianism also led to more sober and simple solutions

<p id="para2"><font size="4">South Korea has a thriving entertainment industry where various facets of South Korean entertainment, including television dramas, films, and popular music, has garnered international popularity and generated significant export revenues for the nation's economy. The cultural phenomenon known as Hallyu or the "Korean Wave", has swept many countries across Continental and East Asia making South Korea a major soft power as an exporter of popular culture and entertainment, rivaling Western nations such as the United States and the United Kingdom.Until the 1990s, trot and traditional Korean folk based ballads dominated South Korean popular music. The emergence of the South Korean pop group Seo Taiji and Boys in 1992 marked a turning point for South Korean popular music, also known as K-pop. Since the 1990s, the genre has continuously re-modernized itself by incorporating elements of popular musical genres and trends from across the world such as Western popular music, experimental, jazz, gospel, Latin, classical, hip hop, rhythm and blues, electronic dance, reggae, country, folk, and rock on top of its uniquely traditional Korean music roots.[383] Though Western-style pop, hip hop, rhythm and blues, rock, folk, electronic dance oriented acts have become dominant in the contemporary South Korean popular music scene, trot is still continues to be appreciated and enjoyed by South Koreans from older generations. K-pop idols, stars, and groups are well known across Continental Asia and have found international fame in the Western World by making millions of dollars in export revenue by harnessing and tapping into new uncharted music markets beyond East Asia.<br><span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">

Originally a hip hop group, their musical style has evolved to incorporate a wide range of genres, while their lyrics have focused on subjects including mental health, the troubles of school-age youth and coming of age, loss, the journey towards self-love, individualism, and the consequences of fame and recognition. Their discography and adjacent work has also referenced literature, philosophy and psychological concepts, and includes an alternate universe storyline.</span>

<p id="para2"><font size="4">Korean dramas more popularly known as K-dramas, refer to television series in the Korean language that are made in South Korea.
They are popular worldwide, especially in Asia, partially due to the spread of Korean popular culture and their widespread availability via streaming services, which often offer subtitles in multiple languages. Many K-dramas have been translated internationally, and some of them have had a significant influence in other nations. In other countries, traditional television channels have broadcast some of the most well-known dramas. For example, Dae Jang Geum was sold in 150 countries.
Korean dramas have attracted international attention for their fashion, style, and culture. Their rise in popularity has led to a great boost to fashion lines.
The “Korean Wave,” or Hallyu, has made great impacts on countries around the world. With the wave came Korean TV Dramas. “In the late 2000s, South Korea was producing more TV dramas than ever before.” <br>The most successful dramas incorporate skillful combinations of familial affection, sex appeal, and emotional desirability. The demand for K-Drama has only increased over the last twenty years after it was nearly destroyed due to Hollywood films, Japanese pop culture, and the financial crisis that hit South Korea since 1997.  K-dramas continue to gain traction internationally today.
K-dramas have a multitude of different genre such as action dramas, historical dramas, school dramas, medical dramas, legal dramas, or even horror comedies. While most dramas contain romantic elements and deep emotional themes, some may also contain a tragedy or slice of life theme. There are various styles and tones.
The main themes of Korean television dramas are friendship, family values, and love, blending traditional Confucian with Western materialism and individualism.
However, it is an emerging trend amongst Korean dramas to showcase ongoing societal issues of Korean society, such as stigma of mental illness, gender inequality, suicide, classism, bullying, spy cameras, corruption, homophobia, or racism.</font></p>

      <p id="para2"><font size="4"><mark>The hanbok</mark> is traditional Korean clothing. It is worn not only by South and North Korea, but also by the joseon-jok, a minority group in China. The term hanbok literally means “Korean clothing.” Hanbok is also depicted in detail on murals from the Goguryeo period in Korea. Due to the isolation from each other for about 50 years, the styles of hanbok in South Korea, North Korea, and joseonjok, worn by the Korean ethnics from these three countries have developed separately from each other.Since the 1990s, the South Korean-style and the North Korean-style have been looking more and more similar to each other.Similarly, since the Chinese economic reform of China, there have been more exchanges with both Koreas leading to both the development and changes in joseonjok-style Chosŏn-ot in China; some of designs of the joseonjok-style Chosŏn-ot have been influenced and inspired by both South-Korean and North Korean hanbok designs.Earliest visual depictions of hanbok can be traced back to the Three Kingdoms of Korea period  with roots in the Proto-Koreanic people of what is now northern Korea and Manchuria; it can also be found in the arts of the Goguryeo tomb murals of the same period from the 4th to 6th century AD, where the basic structure of the hanbok was established at least since this period. <br>The ancient hanbok consisted of a jeogori (top), baji (pants), chima (skirt), and the po (coat). The basic structure of hanbok was designed to facilitate the ease of movement and integrated many motifs of Mu-ism. These basic structural features of the hanbok remains relatively unchanged to this day. However, present-day hanbok, which is worn nowadays, is patterned after the hanbok worn in the Joseon dynasty, especially those worn by the nobility and royalty. In the past, however, commoners (seomin), were not allowed to wear what is now known as hanbok and instead wore minbok (clothing of commoners) which was typically white or off-white in colours; the commoners were only allowed to wear hanbok on their wedding day and on special occasions. The extensive use of white clothing among the commoners lead to Korea being referred as "dressed people of white. Nowadays, contemporary Koreans wear hanbok for formal or semi-formal occasions and events such as weddings, festivals, celebrations, and ceremonies. In 1996, the South Korean Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism established "Hanbok Day" to encourage South Korean citizens to wear the hanbok.</font></p>
